## Simple TODO app written in GO

This is a simple Restful-ish attempt at a todo app in GO. I will be adding more and more components to it as I learn GO. 

I find it easier to learn something if there is a point to the end result so hopefully I can finish this little app and utilize it within an iOS app.

Here are some of the things I hope to accomplish in this example: 

1. Basic CRUD operations on todo items. 
2. Add user registration.
3. Add basic authentication.
4. Build basic search functionalities. 

This project uses PostgreSQL and utilizes this awesome [Go Postgres driver](https://github.com/lib/pq). Just run 
```go get github.com/lib/pq``` if you plan on running this app.
